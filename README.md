The aim of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive customer data management system for a telecom company. The data management system handles subscriber information, 
payment details and service usage. 
The system provides the customer with a seamless and personalized digital service experience, 
that should streamline various customer interactions, enhance customer satisfaction and drive 
loyalty.
The database will store critical information such as customer profiles, customer accounts, 
service plans, call and data usage, payment history, and support ticket logs. This system will 
support efficient data retrieval for customer service, subscribed plans, benefits and wallet 
transactions. 
The customer will automatically create an account upon purchasing a SIM card. This seamless 
process ensures immediate access to account features and services.
